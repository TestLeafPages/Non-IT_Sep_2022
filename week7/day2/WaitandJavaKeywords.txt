Common Implementation of DataProvider
Java Keywords
==================================================

BeforeSuite
 BeforeTest
   BeforeClass
    DataProvider 
	  BeforeMethod
	   @Test



Classroom

Move the dataProvider Method to Projectspecificmethod
Create a method and annotate with @BeforeTest and assign the filename and sheetindex

Selenium Waits:
===============

Implicit wait-->global

Explicit Wait-->Conditional wait

Elementclickinterception
StaleElement
NoSuchElement

WebDriverWait
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(15));
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.conditionstobeapplied)
================

Constructor
-----------
-->special method which initializes the obj
-->It holds the name as same as classname
-->It doesnt have return type
-->specifiers

default constructor/no arg constructor
Parametrized Constructor

this -->refers to the current class objects
-->to overcome the name ambiguty between the local and global variable

Order of Execution in a java class

Static (main)
Constructor
normal

Calling from one constructor into Other Constructor
  ->this keyword is required called Constructor chaining 

Classroom:
Create a class College
Create a instance variable as collegeName
Create a static final variable as building fee
Create a constructor (default)
Create a parametrized constructor (collegeName, depart)

Main method:
Do call the default constructor to print the university
pass the value to the parametrized constructor
